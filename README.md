### Displacement Field Simulation
Data generated by Pierre Bagnaninchi
Simulation of diffuse field wave propagation without noise, including soft inclusions with a shear wavelength of 4mm and 2mm on a 10mm stiff background. Partnered with QPIE algorithm reconstruction approximating mechanical properties with low frame rate sampling (300Hz).
